## 🌟 Project Introduction

VideoLingo is an all-in-one video translation and localization tool designed to generate Netflix-quality subtitles, eliminating stiff machine translations and multi-line subtitles, enabling knowledge sharing across language barriers worldwide.

Key features and functionalities:
- Uses WhisperX for word-level timeline subtitle recognition
- Uses NLP and GPT for subtitle segmentation based on sentence meaning
- GPT summarizes intelligent terminology knowledge base for context-aware translation
- Three-step direct translation, reflection, and paraphrasing to eliminate awkward machine translations
- Netflix-level single-line subtitle length and translation quality
- One-click integrated package launch, one-click video production in Streamlit
- Developer-friendly: Step-by-step structured files for easy customization

VideoLingo automates video downloading, audio extraction, high-precision speech recognition, subtitle generation, high-quality text translation and alignment, and seamless integration of translated subtitles into the original video. With an intuitive Streamlit web interface, you can complete the entire workflow with just a few clicks, easily creating localized videos with Netflix-quality subtitles.

VideoLingo is also actively developing voice cloning technology, which will soon support video dubbing, further enhancing the localization experience. Whether you're a content creator, educator, or someone with multilingual communication needs, VideoLingo can be a powerful assistant, helping you overcome language barriers and connect with global audiences.
