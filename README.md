## 🌟 Overview ([Try VideoLingo Now!](https://videolingo.io))

VideoLingo is an all-in-one video translation, localization, and dubbing tool aimed at generating Netflix-quality subtitles. It eliminates stiff machine translations and multi-line subtitles while adding high-quality dubbing, enabling global knowledge sharing across language barriers.

Key features:
- 🎥 YouTube video download via yt-dlp

- **🎙️ Word-level subtitle recognition with WhisperX**

- **📝 NLP and GPT-based subtitle segmentation**

- **📚 GPT-generated terminology for coherent translation**

- **🔄 3-step direct translation, reflection, and adaptation for professional-level quality**

- **✅ Netflix-standard single-line subtitles only**

- **🗣️ Dubbing alignment with GPT-SoVITS and other methods**

- 🚀 One-click startup and output in Streamlit

- 📝 Detailed logging with progress resumption

Difference from similar projects: **Single-line subtitles only, superior translation quality, seamless dubbing experience**

### Language Support

**Input Language Support(more to come):**

🇺🇸 English 🤩 | 🇷🇺 Russian 😊 | 🇫🇷 French 🤩 | 🇩🇪 German 🤩 | 🇮🇹 Italian 🤩 | 🇪🇸 Spanish 🤩 | 🇯🇵 Japanese 😐 | 🇨🇳 Chinese* 😊

> *Chinese uses a separate punctuation-enhanced whisper model

**Translation supports all languages, while dubbing language depends on the chosen TTS method.**

## Installation

### Windows
Simply double-click `OneKeyInstall&Start.bat` to get started. The script will:
- Download and install Miniconda automatically
- Install all required dependencies for both GPU and CPU

Prerequisites: Git must be installed on your system.

### macOS/Linux 

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Huanshere/VideoLingo.git
cd VideoLingo
```

2. Install dependencies(requires `python=3.10.0`)

```bash
conda create -n videolingo python=3.10.0 -y
conda activate videolingo
python install.py
```

3. Start the application

```bash
streamlit run st.py
```

### Docker
Alternatively, you can use Docker (requires CUDA 12.4 and NVIDIA Driver version >550), see [Docker docs](/docs/pages/docs/docker.en-US.md):

```bash
docker build -t videolingo .
docker run -d -p 8501:8501 --gpus all videolingo
```

## API
The project supports OpenAI-Like API format and various dubbing interfaces:
- `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620`, `gemini-1.5-pro-002`, `gpt-4o`, `qwen2.5-72b-instruct`, `deepseek-coder`, ... (sorted by performance)
- `azure-tts`, `openai-tts`, `siliconflow-fishtts`, `fish-tts`, `GPT-SoVITS`

For detailed installation, API configuration, and batch mode instructions, please refer to the documentation: [English](/docs/pages/docs/start.en-US.md) | [中文](/docs/pages/docs/start.zh-CN.md)

## Current Limitations

1. WhisperX transcription performance may be affected by video background noise, as it uses wav2vac model for alignment. However, WhisperX can still solve 99% of Whisper's hallucination issues.

2. Using weaker models can lead to errors during intermediate processes due to strict JSON format requirements for responses. If this error occurs, please delete the `output` folder and retry with a different LLM, otherwise repeated execution will read the previous erroneous response causing the same error.

3. The dubbing feature may not be 100% perfect due to differences in speech rates and intonation between languages, as well as the impact of the translation step. However, this project has implemented extensive engineering processing for speech rates to ensure the best possible dubbing results.

4. **Multilingual video transcription recognition will only retain the main language**. This is because whisperX uses a specialized model for a single language when forcibly aligning word-level subtitles, and will delete unrecognized languages.

5. **Cannot dub multiple characters separately**, as whisperX's speaker distinction capability is not sufficiently reliable.
