## 🌟 Overview

VideoLingo is an all-in-one video translation, localization, and dubbing tool aimed at generating Netflix-quality subtitles. It eliminates stiff machine translations and multi-line subtitles while adding high-quality dubbing, enabling global knowledge sharing across language barriers. With an intuitive Streamlit interface, you can transform a video link into a localized video with high-quality bilingual subtitles and dubbing in just a few clicks.

**Key features:**
- 🎥 YouTube video download via yt-dlp

- 🎙️ Word-level subtitle recognition with WhisperX

- **📝 NLP and GPT-based subtitle segmentation**

- **📚 GPT-generated terminology for coherent translation**

- **🔄 A 2-step translation process rivaling professional quality**

- **✅ Netflix-standard single-line subtitles only**

- 🗣️ Dubbing alignment (e.g., GPT-SoVITS)

- 🚀 One-click startup and output in Streamlit

- 📝 Detailed logging with progress resumption

- 🌐 Comprehensive multi-language support


Difference from similar projects: **Single-line subtitles only, superior translation quality**

| Chinese* | 🤩 | [Chinese to English](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48f746fe-96ff-47fd-bd23-59e9202b495c) |
> *Chinese requires separate configuration of the whisperX model, only applicable for local source code installation. See the installation documentation for the configuration process, and be sure to specify the transcription language as zh in the webpage sidebar

Translation language support depends on the capabilities of the large language model used, while dubbing language depends on the chosen TTS method.

## 🚀 Quick Start

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

1. **UVR5 voice separation is resource-intensive** and processes slowly. It's recommended to use this feature only on devices with more than 16GB of RAM and 8GB of VRAM. Note: For videos with loud BGM, not performing voice separation before whisper may cause word-level subtitle adhesion, resulting in errors in the final alignment step.

2. **The quality of dubbing may not be perfect** due to differences in language structure and morpheme information density between source and target languages. For best results, choose TTS with similar speech rates based on the original video's speed and content characteristics. The best practice is to train the original video's voice using GPT-SoVITS, then use "Mode 3: Use every reference audio" for dubbing. This ensures maximum consistency in voice, speech rate, and tone. See the [demo](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1mt1QYyERR/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=fa92558c28cd668d33dabaddb17e2f9e) for effects.

3. **Multilingual video transcription recognition will only retain the main language**. This is because whisperX uses a specialized model for a single language when forcibly aligning word-level subtitles, deleting unrecognized languages.

4. **Multi-character separate dubbing is currently unavailable**. While whisperX has VAD potential, specific development is needed, and this feature is not yet implemented.

## 🚗 Roadmap

- [ ] VAD to distinguish speakers, multi-character dubbing
- [ ] Customizable translation styles
- [ ] User terminology glossary
- [ ] Provide commercial services
- [ ] Lip sync for dubbed videos
