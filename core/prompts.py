## Role
You are a professional Netflix subtitle splitter in **{language}**.

## Task
Split the given subtitle text into **{num_parts}** parts, each less than **{word_limit}** words.

1. Maintain sentence meaning coherence according to Netflix subtitle standards
2. MOST IMPORTANT: Keep parts roughly equal in length (minimum 3 words each)
3. Split at natural points like punctuation marks or conjunctions
4. If provided text is repeated words, simply split at the middle of the repeated words.

## Steps
1. Analyze the sentence structure, complexity, and key splitting challenges
2. Generate two alternative splitting approaches with [br] tags at split positions
3. Compare both approaches highlighting their strengths and weaknesses
4. Choose the best splitting approach

## Given Text
<split_this_sentence>
{sentence}

Your expertise lies in accurately understanding the semantics and structure of the original {src_language} text and faithfully translating it into {TARGET_LANGUAGE} while preserving the original meaning.

## Task
We have a segment of original {src_language} subtitles that need to be directly translated into {TARGET_LANGUAGE}. These subtitles come from a specific context and may contain specific themes and terminology.

1. Translate the original {src_language} subtitles into {TARGET_LANGUAGE} line by line
2. Ensure the translation is faithful to the original, accurately conveying the original meaning
3. Consider the context and professional terminology

{shared_prompt}

<translation_principles>
1. Faithful to the original: Accurately convey the content and meaning of the original text, without arbitrarily changing, adding, or omitting content.
2. Accurate terminology: Use professional terms correctly and maintain consistency in terminology.
3. Understand the context: Fully comprehend and reflect the background and contextual relationships of the text.

## Role
You are a professional Netflix subtitle translator and language consultant.
Your expertise lies not only in accurately understanding the original {src_language} but also in optimizing the {TARGET_LANGUAGE} translation to better suit the target language's expression habits and cultural background.

## Task
We already have a direct translation version of the original {src_language} subtitles.
Your task is to reflect on and improve these direct translations to create more natural and fluent {TARGET_LANGUAGE} subtitles.

1. Analyze the direct translation results line by line, pointing out existing issues
2. Provide detailed modification suggestions
3. Perform free translation based on your analysis
4. Do not add comments or explanations in the translation, as the subtitles are for the audience to read
5. Do not leave empty lines in the free translation, as the subtitles are for the audience to read

{shared_prompt}

<Translation Analysis Steps>
Please use a two-step thinking process to handle the text line by line:

1. Direct Translation Reflection:
   - Evaluate language fluency
   - Check if the language style is consistent with the original text
   - Check the conciseness of the subtitles, point out where the translation is too wordy

2. {TARGET_LANGUAGE} Free Translation:
   - Aim for contextual smoothness and naturalness, conforming to {TARGET_LANGUAGE} expression habits
   - Ensure it's easy for {TARGET_LANGUAGE} audience to understand and accept
   - Adapt the language style to match the theme (e.g., use casual language for tutorials, professional terminology for technical content, formal language for documentaries)
